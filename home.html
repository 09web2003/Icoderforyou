            A computer network is a system that connects numerous independent computers in order to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily.
A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.
A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them.

Criteria of good network:

Performance: It can be measured in many ways, including transmit time and response time. Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of the network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of medium & hardware
Reliability: In the addition to accuracy is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from failure, and the network’s robustness in catastrophe. 
Security: Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.  
Goal Of Networking:

Programs do not have to execute on a single system because of resource and load sharing.
Reduced costs – Multiple machines can share printers, tape drives, and other peripherals.
Reliability – If one machine fails, another can take its place.
Scalability (it’s simple to add more processors or computers)
Communication and mail (people living apart can work together)
Information Access (remote information access, access to the internet, e-mail, video conferencing, and online shopping)
Entertainment that is interactive (online games, videos, etc.)
Social Networking
Types of Networks
Division based on the communication medium 

Wired Network: As we all know, “wired” refers to any physical medium made up of cables. Copper wire, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables are all options. A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or another network, such as laptops or desktop PCs.
Wireless Network: “Wireless” means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves. Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices. Cellular phones, wireless sensors, TV remotes, satellite disc receivers, and laptops with WLAN cards are all examples of wireless devices. For data or voice communication, a wireless network uses radio frequency waves rather than wires.
Division based on area covered

Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN is a network that covers an area of around 10 kilometers. For example, a college network or an office network. Depending upon the needs of the organization, a LAN can be a single office, building, or Campus. We can have two PCs and one printer in-home office or it can extend throughout a company and include audio and video devices. Each host in LAN has an identifier, an address that defines hists in LAN. A packet sent by the host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s address.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): MAN refers to a network that covers an entire city. For example: consider the cable television network.
Wide Area Network (WAN): WAN refers to a network that connects countries or continents. For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere around the globe.WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems. A LAN is normally privately owned by an organization that uses it. We see two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and Switched WANs 
          Point To Point: Connects two connecting devices through transmission media. 

          Switched: A switched WAN is a network with more than two ends.

Based on types of communication 

Point To Point networks: Point-to-Point networking is a type of data networking that establishes a direct link between two networking nodes.
A direct link between two devices, such as a computer and a printer, is known as a point-to-point connection.
Multipoint: is the one in which more than two specific devices share links. In the multipoint
